# Platform 3.0 Vision

## Status

Platform 3.0 is in development. v2.5.0 is the final release of the 2.x line,
which is retired ([ADR-0008](adr/0008-retire-the-2x-line.md)). Decisions made
after this vision was first written are recorded in [docs/adr](adr/README.md)
and take precedence where they differ: delivery
([ADR-0002](adr/0002-linux-image-delivered-with-compose.md)), the network core
([ADR-0005](adr/0005-netty-network-core.md)), data access
([ADR-0006](adr/0006-data-access-layer.md)), and the release policy
([ADR-0007](adr/0007-release-policy.md)). The [roadmap](roadmap.md) groups the
work into milestones.

## Purpose

This document defines Platform 3.0, the infrastructure generation after the
2.0 line. The 2.0 line shipped on Windows 10, the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK 25,
and MySQL 8.4. Platform 3.0 replaces that platform. It keeps the Lineage II client protocol and the
gameplay rules, and it changes the operating system, the JDK distribution,
the database, and the shape of the deployment.

The name 3.0 marks a platform change. It is a new host, a new JDK build, and a
new database, assembled as one process.

Read this document in two layers. The next section records what the 2.0 line
delivered. Everything after it is the 3.0 vision.

## What the 2.0 line delivered

v2.5.0 is the final release on this platform. It does not become Platform 3.0.

| Layer | 2.0 line, final release v2.5.0 |
|---|---|
| Acceptance | Windows 10 x64, Microsoft Build of OpenJDK 25, MySQL 8.4 |
| Processes | Login and Game remain two processes. The monolith is not moved here |
| Code | Bytecode 25. Standard JDK APIs only. No dependency on the JDK vendor |
| Data | JDBC and HikariCP 7.1. New schema changes are numbered SQL files. The MySQL dialect stays inside the repository layer. Liquibase is not the release journal. Flyway is not added |
| Scripts | Java scripts are compiled in CI into the Game delivery, and startup loads bytecode. Python is Jython 2.7.5b1 in that same delivery, one checksum manifest with Game |
| Logging | SLF4J 2.0.20 and Logback 1.5 to stdout and named operational files. JUL uses a one-way bridge; Commons Logging is removed |
| IRC | The admin bridge is not a 2.0 feature, and irclib is not a dependency |
| Launch | A `java` command. Default configuration ships in the archive; credentials stay in private deployment files |

Release 2.0.0 does not include Linux as the acceptance host, Temurin as the
acceptance JDK, PostgreSQL, one process, Netty, Generational ZGC, the AOT
cache, a Javolution or Trove replacement, GraalPy, or a datapack revision
separate from Game.

## Fixed platform

| Layer | Decision |
|---|---|
| Operating system | A Linux image, `linux/amd64`, on an Arch Linux base. It runs on Docker Desktop (Windows), Colima (macOS), and Docker Engine (Linux). On Apple Silicon it runs through emulation. |
| JDK | Eclipse Temurin 25, the current long-term support release, as a pinned JRE archive. The next LTS is JDK 29, expected in September 2027. |
| Database | PostgreSQL 18, current minor of that major line. On 30 September 2026 the minor is 18.6. Community support runs until 14 November 2030. |
| Deployment | One image, one process, two client ports: 2106 for login and 7777 for the world. Installed only with `docker compose up -d --wait`. Modules `login` and `world`. The datapack is source that the image contains. |
| Verification | GitHub Actions on Linux for every merge, and a manual check on Docker Desktop and Colima before the release. Developer workstations do not build, test, or run the server. |

PostgreSQL does not publish a separate long-term-support edition. The project
supports each major version for five years. PostgreSQL 18 is the newest line
inside that window. PostgreSQL 19 was still a beta on 30 September 2026 and is
outside this platform. Moving to a later major version is a separate decision
near the end of PostgreSQL 18 support.

## Why this platform

Linux, Temurin 25, and PostgreSQL 18 belong together. Each piece is a version
move. The combination changes networking, startup, concurrency, and data
integrity.

- Linux provides `io_uring`. A Netty 4.2 transport can use it. That path does
  not exist on Windows, which is why replacing the current network core was a
  weak trade on the 2.0 host. Docker's default security profile blocks
  `io_uring` inside containers, so the default transport is epoll and
  `io_uring` is an opt-in ([ADR-0002](adr/0002-linux-image-delivered-with-compose.md)).
- JDK 25 provides virtual threads and scoped values. One process warms once,
  without a native image. G1, the default collector, runs the server
  ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-garbage-collector-and-aot-cache.md)).
- PostgreSQL 18 provides transactional DDL, `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`, advisory
  locks, `SKIP LOCKED`, exclusion constraints, partitioned logs, and `COPY`.
  These are data properties. They are not a wrapper around the MySQL schema.

Eclipse Temurin and the Microsoft Build of OpenJDK are both OpenJDK 25 HotSpot
builds that pass the JCK. Neither includes the Graal compiler. The Microsoft
build matched the Windows 2.0 host. On Linux, Adoptium publishes archives,
container images, deb and rpm packages, x64 and aarch64, including Alpine.
Server behavior does not change with the vendor string. `java.vendor` becomes
Eclipse Adoptium. Oracle JDK 25 updates move to a different license after
autumn 2028. Temurin does not have that split. The image pairs the Temurin
JRE archive with an Arch Linux base and does not use Arch's JDK package, which
follows the newest JDK.

The server stays a Java MMORPG server. Quarkus, Spring, and a reactive database
stack are not added. Virtual threads plus JDBC cover the workload that used to
justify a database event loop. Neither Kubernetes nor systemd is part of the
platform. One compose file runs the image and PostgreSQL 18 on Docker Desktop,
Colima, or Docker Engine.

## Modular monolith

The Lineage II client opens two connections. It speaks to the login port,
receives the world list and a session key, then opens a second connection to
the world port. That is a property of the client protocol. It does not require
two programs, two images, or two JVMs.

Today the login server and the game server are two products. Each has its own
`main`, and they admit a player through an internal socket protocol. On a
single-world host that socket connects a process to itself over loopback. Two
heaps and two deliveries exist for a topology this platform does not ship: one
login fronting several worlds.

Platform 3.0 is a modular monolith of one world.

One Temurin 25 process listens on both client ports. The `login` module owns
the login port, accounts in the `login` schema, and session-key issue. The
`world` module owns the world port, the simulation, and the `world` and
`catalog` schemas. Admission is a Java call in the same process: login marks
the account busy and passes the key, and world checks that key in memory. The
internal login-to-world TCP connection leaves the release. The client still
sees two addresses.

The module boundary holds. `world` does not read passwords and does not write
the `login` schema. `login` does not see the catalog, characters, or world
packets. The shared session-key and world-list types live in a small contract
module.

One process fits because there is one world. A restart already drops play.
A login process that stays up during that restart does not keep the world
session. A shared heap and a shared collector are an accepted cost: the
collector is configured once, and a world deadlock is visible in one JFR
recording. A second world on the same login is a later product. The same Java
admission interface could then grow a socket adapter, and the second world
would be another process of the same image. Platform 3.0 does not build that
adapter in advance.

## Stack

| Area | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | G1 | Measured against ZGC: the start is 16 % faster and the resident memory half as large ([ADR-0012](adr/0012-garbage-collector-and-aot-cache.md)). |
| Startup | No AOT cache | The cache saved at most 5 % of a 17 s start and needs a database in the image build. A native image is the wrong tool for a long-running HotSpot server. |
| JDBC driver | pgjdbc 42.7.13 | BSD license, ordinary JDBC, current PostgreSQL coverage. |
| Driver candidate | pg-java | August 2026 pre-release. Blocking API that avoids pinning virtual threads. It enters a release only after full JDBC coverage and a comparison with pgjdbc. |
| Pool | HikariCP 7.1 | The pool stays small. Virtual threads wait for a connection. One connection per thread overloads PostgreSQL. |
| Migrations | Flyway 13, PostgreSQL module | Plain SQL in the repository. The PostgreSQL module is Apache 2.0. Transactional DDL makes a migration atomic. Liquibase 5 is declined on license terms. |
| Network | Own protocol codec on Netty 4.2. Transport is `io_uring`, then epoll, then NIO. The container default is epoll | Adopted by decision without a packet-replay comparison ([ADR-0005](adr/0005-netty-network-core.md)). Conformance tests on fixed vectors and an end-to-end smoke test cover the risk. The previous core is not in the 3.0 release. |
| Logging | SLF4J 2.0.20 and Logback 1.5 to stdout and named operational files | The 2.0 line completes the backend migration. Platform 3.0 retains the unified backend and named audit/gameplay channels. |
| IRC | Not included | The admin bridge and irclib are removed on the 2.0 line. Platform 3.0 does not add an IRC client. |
| Threads | Virtual threads for login, JDBC, admin, and background I/O. Scoped values replace `ThreadLocal` | World ticks, knownlist, and AI stay on platform threads. The promotion check includes a pinning report. |
| Scripts and catalog | Built into the image in CI | Datapack sources are not a release archive. Java scripts ship as bytecode. Python is one runtime inside the image. ECJ in the running process is a development tool. |
| Python | Jython 2.7 final inside the image | Same line as the 2.0.0 choice, Jython 2.7.5b1. The final release drops the beta. GraalPy is excluded: the datapack stays on Python 2, and GraalPy speed requires GraalVM. |
| Observability | Always-on JFR, OpenTelemetry Java agent, `pg_stat_statements`, `auto_explain` | An incident is captured without a restart: JVM recording, pool, task queue, slow SQL. |
| Delivery | Non-root image on a pinned Arch Linux base, Temurin 25 JRE archive pinned by checksum, SBOM, cosign signature, checksums | CI builds the image and starts it with the compose bundle. The database is the official `postgres` image of the 18 line, pinned by digest ([ADR-0002](adr/0002-linux-image-delivered-with-compose.md), [ADR-0007](adr/0007-release-policy.md)). |
| Tests | JUnit 6, AssertJ, Mockito, Testcontainers with PostgreSQL 18 | The same major line as the acceptance host. |

Javolution 5.4.1 leaves the release. Cold paths use the JDK collections.
Hot paths shown by JFR use the JDK as well: `ArrayList`, `ArrayDeque`, and
`ConcurrentHashMap`. No replacement structural library is added.

Trove 2.1.0 leaves the release. fastutil replaces it only where JFR shows
primitive maps and sets on world loops. Every other site uses the JDK
collections. Both replacements happen after the Linux flight recording, not
during the 2.0 Windows acceptance.

## Data

Data is split by lifetime. The old datapack archive mixed all of it: XML and
CSV stats, HTML, zones, geodata, 449 Python scripts, about 175 Java scripts,
dialog pages, catalog SQL for items, NPCs, and spawns, character tables, an
`updates/` history, and side mods under `optional/`. Operators had to match
that archive to the game-server build.

Platform 3.0 ships one image. The login, world, and catalog revisions are the
image digest. The datapack tree remains the place where content is written. CI
bakes it into the image. Operators do not unpack it.

| Data | Owner | Where it lives | On a new image |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accounts | `login` | Schema `login`, Flyway | Forward only. World content never lands here. |
| Characters, items, clans, mail, quest progress | `world` | Schema `world`, Flyway | Forward only. A catalog load does not overwrite or delete it. |
| Item templates, NPCs, skills, spawns, zones, HTML, geodata, scripts | `world` | Schema `catalog` and files inside the image | Startup compares the catalog revision with the image. A different revision is replaced wholesale with `COPY`. Player state stays. |

The `catalog` schema can be rebuilt from the image. The `world` schema cannot:
it is the backup. The `login` backup is accounts. Geodata and HTML are layers
of the same image. A large layer is still addressed by the image digest.

Scripts are not compiled at server start. CI compiles Java scripts against the
server classpath, and the image loads bytecode. Python runs on Jython 2.7
final in that image. GraalPy is not on the classpath and not in CI. A mod under `optional/` is either part of
the image build or it is absent.

The historical `sql/updates` chain and the installer that records progress in
Java Preferences end. `login` and `world` move by numbered Flyway SQL. The
catalog does not replay years of incremental updates. The new image brings its
catalog whole. The process refuses players when the catalog revision does not
match the image. The `login` module does not read the catalog.

## What PostgreSQL changes in the server

The schema is not the MySQL schema with another driver. [ADR-0013](adr/0013-what-the-platform-takes-from-postgresql.md)
records what the platform takes from PostgreSQL and what it leaves.

- A player, its items, and its adena are saved in one transaction, with
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`.
- A second server on the same world database is refused with an advisory lock.
- Character, clan, and account names are unique without regard to case
  (`citext`).
- Tables that make their own key use identities. Player, item, and clan ids stay
  integers, because the client protocol carries them as 32-bit numbers.
- The image loads its catalog with `COPY`.

The MySQL translation is its own work: `tinyint`, `datetime`, `enum`,
backticks, `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`, and `AUTO_INCREMENT`. It is not hidden
inside the pool change. A lock per account, queues claimed with row locks, and
partitioned logs belong to a server with several processes or with logs in the
database; this platform has neither.

## Sequence

These steps start from the final 2.0 release, v2.5.0. They are grouped into
three milestones in the [roadmap](roadmap.md). They do not repeat the logging,
IRC, Jython 2.7.5b1, or CI script work from that release.

1. Move CI and the image to Linux. The image runs with Docker Compose and
   publishes ports 2106 and 7777. Remove Windows from the acceptance gate.
2. Move the data to PostgreSQL 18 with the accepted data design: Flyway,
   Testcontainers, and a vertical slice of account and character save and
   restart ([ADR-0004](adr/0004-postgresql-and-the-accepted-data-design.md)).
   There is no parallel run of MySQL and no migration of 2.x databases.
3. Move the remaining JDBC paths to PostgreSQL behind the targeted repository
   seam ([ADR-0006](adr/0006-data-access-layer.md)). The pool has a wait
   ceiling and its metrics are exposed over JMX.
4. Measure the start under G1 and ZGC, with and without the AOT cache, and
   keep the fastest configuration that needs no extra build step (done:
   [ADR-0012](adr/0012-garbage-collector-and-aot-cache.md)).
5. Build the catalog and scripts into the image. Remove the separate datapack
   archive. Split `login`, `world`, and `catalog`.
6. Collapse login and world into one process and replace the internal
   admission socket with the in-process contract.
7. Move the transport to Netty 4.2 with epoll by default. Keep the protocol
   codec. Accept the port with conformance tests and an end-to-end smoke test
   ([ADR-0005](adr/0005-netty-network-core.md)). The previous core is not
   released.
8. Replace Javolution and Trove with the JDK collections. Their sites are cold
   paths, so the platform does not need fastutil; it can come back where a
   flight recording under load shows a hot primitive path.
9. Release Platform 3.0 as one image plus PostgreSQL 18, once
   ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-release-policy.md)). The catalog arrives inside the
   image. The image no longer contains Commons Logging, irclib, Javolution, Trove,
   GraalPy, or the previous network core.

## Outside this platform

- PostgreSQL 19, until a later decision changes the major line.
- The Microsoft Build of OpenJDK and Oracle JDK.
- Windows and macOS as native hosts. They run the Linux image through Docker Desktop or Colima.
- systemd units, Kubernetes manifests, and install scripts on the host.
- A native arm64 image. The amd64 image runs through emulation on Apple Silicon.
- MySQL.
- GraalPy, GraalVM, and any second Python interpreter. Jython 2.7.5b1 is replaced by the Jython 2.7 final release.
- pg-java while it is a pre-release.
- Quarkus, Spring, and R2DBC.
- Virtual threads on world ticks.
- The previous network core, Commons Logging, irclib, Javolution, and Trove.
- A separate datapack archive, a shared content volume, and a catalog outside
  the image. The operator directory can override any key, the catalog path
  included, but the platform neither offers nor supports another catalog.
- A second world process and the socket adapter that would serve it.

## Relationship to 2.0.0

The 2.0 line is retired ([ADR-0008](adr/0008-retire-the-2x-line.md)). Its
documents remain as history and describe Windows 10, MySQL 8.4, and two
processes. Nothing in the 3.0 line has to satisfy the 2.0 contract. Platform
3.0 moves the Jython pin to the 2.7 final release and completes the JDK,
collection, and Netty replacements above.
