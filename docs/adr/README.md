# Architecture decision records

Each record states one decision, why it was made, what it costs, and when to revisit it. A record is immutable once accepted: a later record supersedes it instead of editing the history.

## Format

Every record has these sections: Status, Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences, Revisit when. Statuses are Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by NNNN, and Rejected. A decision made by the maintainer without a comparison says so in its Context.

Number records in order and keep each to about one page. Evidence such as measurements goes into `docs/reports/` and is linked from the record.
