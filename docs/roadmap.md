# Roadmap

Platform 3.0 is built in three milestones and shipped as one release, `v3.0.0` ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-release-policy.md)). A milestone is a checkable outcome, not a version. Only one milestone is open at a time. The [Platform 3.0 project board](https://github.com/users/l2go/projects/2) shows the live state of the work. The board of the 2.x program is a closed record and receives no 3.0 cards.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Outcome | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M1. Foundation | Decisions recorded, vision revised, 2.x retired, docs structured, and a pipeline that builds a Linux image and starts it with Docker Compose in CI | In progress |
| M2. Platform 3.0 | The image runs on PostgreSQL 18 in one process with Netty. An end-to-end smoke test (log in, list the world, enter it, leave) is green in CI. A real client has reached the world | Not started |
| M3. Release | Runbook, restore rehearsal, threat model, vulnerability policy, signature and SBOM verified, and the tag `v3.0.0` | Not started |

## Exit criteria

M1 is done when all of these hold:

1. The decision records in [docs/adr](adr/README.md) cover platform and delivery, process model, data, network, data access, release policy, and retirement of 2.x.
2. `docs/index.md` lists every document with its status, and the vision matches the records.
3. A pipeline builds the Linux image and runs `docker compose up -d --wait` in CI. The login port answers with its first packet and the world port accepts connections. Pushes to `main` publish the `edge` and `sha-<commit>` images.
4. The required checks in the `main` ruleset match the new pipeline.
5. The risk register is reviewed.

M2 is done when:

1. Account and character save and restart pass on PostgreSQL 18 in CI.
2. Login and world run in one process, and the architecture rules report no forbidden dependencies between modules.
3. The Netty core passes the frame and cipher conformance tests, and the end-to-end smoke test is green.
4. The suspected concurrency defects listed in the risk register are confirmed or dismissed with tests, and the confirmed ones are fixed.
5. Start-up time is measured in CI and the collector and AOT-cache decision is recorded with numbers.
6. The maintainer has run a real client against the `edge` image.

M3 is done when:

1. The runbook covers first start, backup, restore, upgrade of the image, and incident capture, and the restore has been rehearsed on a clean host.
2. The threat model is written and checked against the delivered image.
3. The vulnerability policy is in force and the scan passes under it.
4. The cosign signature and the SBOM verify with the commands in the documentation.
5. The maintainer has run a real client again and approved the release in the `stable-release` environment.

## Work packages

Work is cut into a few large packages along module boundaries, not into small slices.

| Package | Milestone | Content |
|---|---|---|
| WP1. Decisions and direction | M1 | Decision records, vision revision, roadmap, risk register, docs index, retirement of 2.x |
| WP2. Pipeline and image | M1 | Image on a pinned Arch Linux base, compose bundle, start-to-ready check, first-packet probe, ruleset update |
| WP3. Data | M2 | Schemas, migrations, catalog loader, repository seam for inventory, player, and clan |
| WP4. Modules and one process | M2 | Contract module, admission in process, dependency rules, configuration model |
| WP5. Network on Netty | M2 | Netty pipeline, conformance tests, end-to-end smoke test |
| WP6. Runtime | M2 | JDK collections, thread model, known concurrency defects |
| WP7. Measurements | M2 | Repeatable start-up measurement and the collector decision |
| WP8. Operations | M3 | Runbook, observability, restore rehearsal, threat model |
| WP9. Release | M3 | Policy checks, verification of signature and SBOM, the tag |

## Reports

Each milestone ends with a report in `docs/reports/` that states the plan, the result, the deviations, and the delivery numbers from the repository history. The reports are written when a milestone closes.
