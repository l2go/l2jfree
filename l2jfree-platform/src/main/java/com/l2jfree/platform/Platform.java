/**
 * Starts the login module and the world module in one process (ADR-0003).
 * <p>
 * The order is fixed. The login module prepares itself and opens no port. The world loads everything it needs and
 * opens its port, and it is handed the login module through the contract. Only then the login module opens its
 * port, so a client that reaches the login finds a world. A failure in any step ends the process with status 1 ({@link StartupGuard}).
 * <p>
 * The class extends {@link L2AutoInitialization} for its static initializer, which sets up logging, the
 * uncaught-exception handler and the class path check once, as the two former entry points did.
